Here is a workflow in the form of python code and it got wrong on this particular task. please see his trajectory and the ground truth final answer and try to deduce which Step went wrong after so please refine the workflow so as to reach the correct answer of course you should not give the answer away or use any method that will not be generally applicable to other problems similar.



Here is a workflow in the form of python code that correctly answered a task however since some of the steps or prompts may be redundant or suboptimal you are tasked to reduce this workflow to a more concise form that can still correctly solve this task. 




Here are 2 workflows and their trajectories on two tasks respectively. each workflow got a different task right and your task is to analyze their strengths and weaknesses to come up with a workflow combining their strengths and get both tasks right, without, of course, giving out answers or task specific hints but be generally applicable to other tasks of the same kind.
